2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.416 ns between cin (clocked by virtual_clock) and x1 (clocked by virtual_clock). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.508 ns between cin (clocked by virtual_clock) and x2 (clocked by virtual_clock). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#1 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of 0.100 ns has been defined on port 'cin' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

Related violations: <none>

XDCH-2#2 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of 0.100 ns has been defined on port 'sel_a' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
set_input_delay -clock [get_clocks virtual_clock] -max -add_delay 0.100 [get_ports sel_a]

XDCH-2#3 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of 0.100 ns has been defined on port 'y1' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

XDCH-2#4 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of 0.100 ns has been defined on port 'y2' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

XDCH-2#5 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of 0.100 ns has been defined on port 'z1' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

XDCH-2#6 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same input delay of 0.100 ns has been defined on port 'z2' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.

XDCH-2#7 Warning
Same min and max delay values on IO port  
The same output delay of 0.100 ns has been defined on port 'x1' relative to clock virtual_clock for both max and min. Make sure this reflects the design intent.
