\section{Introduction}
For lab 2 our task was to familiarize our self with using seven-segment displays and more about how decoders and full adders work.  During these steps we have to create truth tables to gather the right information. We use these truth tables to code each program in VHDL also so that we have the right implemented display on our Basys 3 board. We have three programming assignments for this lab. The first assignment was to write VHDL code to map out a seven segment display where it consist numbers 0-9 to display on the board. The second assignment was to write a VHDL code and create a truth table for a 1:2 decoder using two inputs and two outputs also using a AND and OR gate.  The third assignment was to write a VHDL code for the expression output SUM, considering we have a full adder with three inputs A,B, and Carryin and two outputs SUM and Carry out. 
\section{Background, Design Solution, and Results}

\subsection{Problem 1 Seven Segment Display}

\subsubsection{Background}
This problem prompted us to utilize the seven-segment display on the Basys3 board. Our input will be a 3-bit number so that we can provide input from 0-9, which is the range that can be displayed by a single seven-segment display. Seven-segment displays include, fittingly, seven segments. Those segments are conventionally referred to as a-g in accordance with Figure ~\ref{fig:sevenSegMap}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\caption{Seven-Segment Display Map}
\label{fig:sevenSegMap}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Design Solution}
As discussed in the background for this problem, a seven-segment display can only display a single-digit 0-9. We have to use a 4-bit number in order to represent 9 (1001b) however, 10-15 (1010b-1111b) cannot be displayed using a single seven-segment display. In our code, this will be treated as an error condition where no data will be displayed on the seven-segment display. The 4-bit input will be x3 down to x0, with x3 as the most significant bit, and the output bits have been defined in the assignment. The input pin assignments are defined in Table ~\ref{tab:sevenSigInput} and the output pin assignments as well as their segment are defined in Table ~\ref{tab:sevenSigOutput}. The truth table for our seven segment decoder is shown in Table ~\ref{tab:sevenSegTruthTable}. During our design process, we remembered that the seven-segment display is "active-low", meaning that a '0' is treated as "ON" and a '1' is treated as "OFF". This was important when designing our truth table.

\subsection{Results}

The resulting circuit successfully displayed the digit corresponding to each 4-bit number from 0-9. We were also able to correctly turn off all displays when an input greater than 9 was provided. Initially, the number 6 displayed incorrectly, we activated segment 'f' by mistake, therefore displaying '8'. Once this problem was identified, we were able to quickly address it and provide the correct output.

\subsection{Problem 2 1:2 Decoder}

\subsubsection{Background}
The task posed for this problem was to develop a 1:2 decoder and implement it on the Basys3. The design will include 2 inputs, a 1-bit number and an enable bit.

\subsubsection{Design Solution}
The 1:2 decoder will accept a 1-bit input 'a', and is controlled by the bit 'sel'. The output is made up of bits 'out1' and 'out2'. The ports are described in Table ~\ref{tab:decoderPort}.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
			\hline
			Bit & Label & Address \\ \hline
			a & Switch 0 & V17 \\ \hline
			sel & Switch 1 & V16 \\ \hline
			out1 & LED 0 & U16 \\ \hline
			out2 & LED 1 & E19 \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{\label{tab: tab-name} Input and output port assignments for 1:2 decoder.}
		\label{tab:decoderPort}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The decoder will only produce input when 'sel', the enable bit, is HIGH. When 'sel' is HIGH, the decoder will activate the 'out1' bit, representing the decimal value "0". When 'a' is HIGH when 'sel' is HIGH, the decoder will activate the 'out2' bit, representing the decimal value "1". This is summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:decoderTruthTable}.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
		\hline
		a & sel & out1 & out2 \\ \hline
		0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
		0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
		1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
		1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Results}

\subsection{Problem 3 SUM of a Full Adder}

\subsubsection{Background}

A full adder is designed to incorporate both a carry-in and carry-out bit, which makes it more modular and allows us to build multi-bit adders. For this problem, we are to design a full adder that will accept a carry-in, a carry-out, and perform addition of two bits.

\theoremstyle{definition}
\newtheorem{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
Carry-in Bit: the carry-in bit represents a 1-bit overflow from a previous addition operation. Because a full adder is intended to be modular, and build adders of multiple bits, it is important that the previous operation be available. For purposes of this lab, the carry-in for a 1 bit adder will be tied to ground.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Carry-out Bit: the carry-out bit represents a 1-bit overflow from the current addition operation. This can either be used to signal an error condition or to tie this adder in with multiple full adders. The result of this addition operation will either between 0 and 3. If the output is 2 or 3, the carry-out bit will be HIGH to signal that there is an additional bit needed to represent the results of this operation.
\end{definition}
