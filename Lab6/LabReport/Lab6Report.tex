\section{Introduction}
The object of this lab is to implement two different types of state machines, Mealy and Moore. State machines are defined in Definition ~\ref{def:state_machine}. State machines are useful for a wide range of applications, most basically as a sequence detector. Sequence detectors are state machines that will output '1' or HIGH when a set sequence of inputs is detected.

\section{Background, Design Solution, and Results}

\subsection{Problem 1 }

\subsubsection{Background}
Our first task in the lab was not to implement a state machine directly. Rather, the first task was to implement a clock divider that will slow down the frequency of the clock to a speed that a human can work with. In order to implement and test our sequence detectors, we will need time to provide the inputs between each clock cycle. The Basys3 board has a 100 MHz clock, and our task for this lab was to slow it down as low as 1 Hz.

\subsubsection{Design Solution}
In order to reduce the clock speed from 100 MHz, or 100,000,000 Hz, to approximately 1 Hz, we had to derive the approximate number of clock cycles it will take, and identify the number of bits used to represent that value. Equation ~\ref{eqn:decimal_to_binary} shows the conversion to a 27 bit binary number. Once we knew that the number was 27 bits, we plugged 27 into the provided code. The port assignments used for the clock divider are summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:clockDivider_input_Ports}.

\begin{equation}
100 000 000d = 101111101011110000100000000b
\label{eqn:decimal_to_binary}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Results}
The clock divider successfully slowed the clock signal from 100 MHz to 1 Hz, or 1 iteration per second. The functioning clock is shown in Figures ~\ref{fig:part1img1} through ~\ref{fig:part1img3}.

\end{figure}
\end{center}

\subsection{Problem 2 }

\subsubsection{Background}
For Problem 2, we had to utilize our clock divider implemented in Problem 1 as we design and test a Moore State Machine. A Moore State Machine is one who's output depends only on the current state, not on the input. The inputs can be used to progress a Moore State Machine through its given states, but its output does not care what the input is. 

\subsubsection{Design Solution}
For our design, we had to implement a 10-state Moore Machine that would output '1' or HIGH at 2 states of our choice. For the purposed of this experiment, we selected state 4 and state 8. The state diagram is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:moore_state_diagram}. Basically, this machine should progress through the states every clock cycle as long as the enable bit is '1' or HIGH. When it reaches state 9, it should return to state 0. The ports for this design are summarized in Tables ~\ref{tab:moore_input_ports} and ~\ref{tab:moore_output_ports}.

\subsubsection{Results}
The state machine successfully progressed through the states and output '1' in states 4 and 8. Some example outputs of the Moore State Machine are shown in Figures ~\ref{fig:part2img1} through ~\ref{fig:part2img5}.

\end{figure}
\end{center}

\subsection{Problem 3}

\subsubsection{Background}
Problem 3 will use the clock divider to test a Mealy State Machine acting as a sequence detector. A Mealy State Machine provides output depending on its current state and its input. This generally lowers the amount of states required to implement a state machine. This state machine should output '1' or HIGH when either "101" or "010" is detected by the input.

\subsubsection{Design Solution}
We implemented this Mealy State Machine without overlap to detect the sequences "101" or "010". Basically, without overlap means that after detecting a sequence, the state machine returns to the original state and starts over. Therefore, if the input was "01010", the first "010" would be detected, but "10" would not trigger an output becuase the sequence has started over. The state diagram is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:mealy_machine}. Port assignments for this design are shown in Tables ~\ref{tab:mealy_input_ports} and ~\ref{tab:_mealy_output_ports}.

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, by completing this lab we learned the implementation details of Mealy and Moore state machines in VHDL. This will be important for many tasks in digital system design. The most significant challenge for this lab was designing the Mealy State Machine for two potential sequences, but by carefully diagramming them together we were able to complete a design. State machines are essential building blocks of digital circuits, and now that we have completed them we can move on to even more advanced design.
