\section{Introduction}
For this first lab our task was to familiarize ourselves with Xilinx Vivado Design Suite and the Digilent Basys3 FPGA Development Board that is used in this lab. During these tasks we learned how to configure the settings on Vivado for our board and how to load a program to the board. We also have three programming assignments for this lab. The first assignment was to write a simple VHDL program using an AND gate with two inputs and one output. The second assignment was to write a VHDL program using the car alarm example which that we derived in class. Our car alarm consists of 3 inputs using switches and 2 outputs using LED lights.  The third assignment was to create our own design implementation and write a VHDL program using only 4 inputs and 3 outputs. For our third assignment, we elected to build an adder for two 2-bit numbers. Upon successfully completing this lab, we will be able to work comfortable translating our circuit designs and VHDL code to a Vivado project and implement it on the Basys3 board.

\section{Background, Design Solution, and Results}
\subsection{Problem 1: 2-bit AND Gate}
The objective of this problem is to implement a single 2-bit AND gate in VHDL using the Basys3. The circuit diagram for this problem is in Figure 1 below.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{\label{fig:figure-name}Circuit diagram for AND gate.}
\end{figure}

The inputs for this problem are named 'A' and 'B' and the output is named 'C'.


\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
		\hline
		Bit & Label & Address\\ \hline
		A & Switch 1 & V16\\ \hline
		B & Switch 7 & W13\\ \hline
		C & LED 3 & V19\\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:table-name}Input and output bit specifications for problem 1.}
\end{center}
\end{table}

These inputs and outputs will interact according to the properties of an AND gate, shown in the truth table below.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
		\hline
		A & B & C \\ \hline
		0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
		0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
		1 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
		1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:table-name}Truth Table for Problem 1.}
\end{center}	
\end{table}



\subsection{Problem 2: Car Alarm}

Problem 2 referenced a car alarm system designed in class. The car alarm is made up of two sensors, a vibration sensor ('V') and a door sensor ('D'). The system is considered "active" when the master switch ('M') is activated. The car alarm has one output, an alarm siren ('S'). The logical circuit diagram for this is noted below.

\end{figure}

The circuit of Figure 2 above translates to the following truth table:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}
	\hline
	D & V & M & S \\ \hline
	0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline
	0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \hline
	0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline	
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:table-name}Truth table for the car alarm.}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The given map for the input and output bits told us where we should assign each bit from our system.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
		\hline
		Bit & Label & Address \\ \hline
		D & Button L & W19 \\ \hline
		V & Switch 15 & R2 \\ \hline
		M & Button R & T17 \\ \hline
		D & LED 7 & V19 \\ \hline
		E & LED 6 & U14 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\label{tab:table-name}Input and output bit specification for car alarm.}
\end{center}	
\end{table}

\subsection{Problem 3: Design Our Own Circuit}
For our own circuit design, we implemented a simple adder for two 2-bit numbers. Our circuit consists of two full adders with ripple carry. There is assumed to be no carry-in for this system so the carry-in for our least significant bit adder is tied to 0. This design utilizes a component that reuses VHDL code for each full bit adder. This improved our practical understanding of components and streamlined the code process. The two bit numbers x and y are denoted as 'X1', 'X0', 'Y1', and 'Y0' where 1 is the most significant bit and 0 is the least significant bit of the respective number. The output, z, is represented as the bits 'Z1' and 'Z0', where 1 is the most significant bit and 0 is the least significant bit. The carry-out bit is represented by 'cout'
